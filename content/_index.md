## Welcome!

At FOSDEM 2020 we're having the 1st edition of a Devroom completely dedicated to the BEAM (and all languages running on it). [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) is an annual conference about free and open source software, attended by over 5000 developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the world.

The Devroom will take place on Saturday, 1 February 2020, at [ULB (Campus Solbosch)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1632534522), in Brussels, Belgium. Join us to enjoy interesting talks, demos and discussions about Erlang, Elixir, and possibly other languages running on the BEAM!

If this has piqued your interest, please [submit your talk proposal here]({{< ref "call-for-talks.md" >}}), and we'll see you in Brussels!

Last, but not least, be aware of FOSDEMâ€™s [Code of Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2020/practical/conduct/).
