## Welcome!

At FOSDEM 2024 we're having the 3rd edition of a Devroom completely dedicated to the BEAM (and all
languages running on it). [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) is an annual conference about free and open
source software, attended by over 8000 developers and open-source enthusiasts from all over the
world.

### When and where

The devroom will take place on Saturday, 3rd February 2023, between 10:30 and 14:30. It will be
hosted in Room [K.4.601](https://nav.fosdem.org/l/k4601/) at [ULB Campus Solbosch (Brussels,
