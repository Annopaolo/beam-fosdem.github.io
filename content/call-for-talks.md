The Erlang, Elixir, Gleam and Friends Devroom will take place in person at FOSDEM on **Saturday (morning), 3rd February 2024**.

We invite authors to submit original, high-quality work with sufficient background material to be clear to the BEAM community.

## Topics

We welcome any talk proposals about BEAM-related projects. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  - Languages running on the BEAM (Erlang, Elixir, Gleam, et al.)
      - Introduction to the language
  - Recent features and roadmap
  - Interesting libraries
  - Frameworks
  - Open Source projects that run on the BEAM
  - Tooling
  - Scalability and reliability
  - Community initiatives

## Talk length

For the talk length we will support different slots:
  - Long (40 minutes, including Q&A)
  - Short (20 minutes, including Q&A)
  - Lightning (5 minutes, no Q&A)

Please specify your preferred slot length, but note that we could ask submitters to fit into a different slot for scheduling purposes.

## Submission details

Please be aware of the fact that Devroom talks at FOSDEM will be recorded. By submitting a proposal you agree to being recorded and to have your talk made available.

Submissions must include:
  - Title (Event title in Pretalx)
  - Abstract

These additional details must be included in the 'Submission notes' section:

  - Desired slot length (please specify if you're willing to accept a shorter slot if there's the need)
  - Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
  - Speaker bio
  - Links to previous talks by the speaker (optional)
  - Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)

Note that this year the submission system changed from Pentabarf to Pretalx and accounts were not migrated: you will have to create a new Pretalx account.
