In addition to the Devroom, we're also organizing a BEAM FOSDEM Meetup for Saturday evening (4th of February 2023) to allow us to catch up with all the BEAM enthusiasts in Bruxelles.

The chosen meetup location is the [Brewdog Brewery](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/brewdog-brussels) since it has lots of room to accomodate people and it also serves food in case someone wants to have dinner there.

The planned starting time is 8 PM, but don't be afraid to join afterwards if you can't make it for that time. The idea is that people should generally come and go as they please, once the first flock forms, the meetup should be self-evident and self-sustaining (do wear some obviously BEAM-themed clothes if you have them so that newcomers can easily find the group ðŸ¤“).

The point of contact for the Saturday Meetup is [Tuxified](https://github.com/Tuxified), so ping him [on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@Tuxified) if you think you're going to join us or if you need some additional details, or get in touch with us at *erlang-devroom-manager[at]fosdem.org*.

Hope to see many of you in Brussels!
